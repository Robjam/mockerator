## Mockerator

Generate concrete factory functions from TypeScript types.

### Usage

```
npm install -g mockerator
```

```
mockerator "./types/**" --outDir "./mocks"
```

## Caveats

This is very much a work in progress. There are a lot of features of TypeScript that are probably not supported (yet). If you come across an error, make an issue if you have the time.
